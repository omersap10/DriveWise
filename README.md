# DriveWise
DriveWise is a project focused on leveraging web crawling techniques to gather comprehensive mechanical information, status, and pricing data from car sales websites. 
By employing machine learning algorithms such as K-nearest neighbors (KNN), Random Forest, and Linear Regression, DriveWise aims to develop a powerful predictive model capable of estimating car prices based on their mechanical condition.
By combining the vast dataset obtained through web crawling with the analytical power of machine learning, DriveWise seeks to provide valuable insights and accurate predictions to assist individuals in making informed decisions when buying or selling cars.
